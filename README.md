# Data Visualization of Gun Violence in US
Build using shiny dashboard on R Langunage

Data source: [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data)

* The csv file is quite big (>100MB), so I can't upload it to the repository
* To run this project in your local, please download the data file from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data) and copy the csv file into the root of this repository and rename it to **gun-violence-data.csv**.
* You can run the project as usual
